Turkey stands on the center of multiple fault lines, with huge earthquake expected in Istanbul soon, threatining tens of millions of lives. I worked on different solutions before to help minimize the impact of the upcoming earthquakes and have a pending patent in the field.

After a 6.2 magnitude earthquake happened in Turkey on 23 April 2025, I decided to build an automated prediction workflow that scrapes thousands of past earthquakes from the website of Kandilli Rasathanesi (Earthquake Research Institute), saves them into a database, uses a regressive time series model to predict potential upcoming earthquakes, generates a post based on the earthquake prediction, and finally, decides to tweet it or not considering factors like location, magnitude and depth of the predicted earthquake.

As millions of people are on their toes, we aim to keep people notified in advance. Every minute matters.
